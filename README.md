Food Delivery Prediction ML Model: Basic Analysis of Dataset in Jupyter Notebook
Dataset: Both .txt and .csv files are added. I used .txt file in the project.
ML_Model_FD: I used Google Colab for building the ML model and testing it. I had to switch from Jupyter Notebook due to storage issues. Google Colab worked perfectly.
